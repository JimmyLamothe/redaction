Functionality:
	- Autocomplete is displayed in gray
	- Autocomplete is only called when character is typed after end of last word
	- Changing the cursor position deletes the suggestion

Attributes:
	- current_text = str
	- current_cursor = int
	- suggestion_text = str
	- suggestion_active = bool

Methods:
	- cursor_at_end -> bool
	- cursor_moved -> str or bool
	- ignore_suggestion
	- confirm_suggestion
	- get_difference -> str
	
Concept:
	If not suggestion_active:
	   If char received and cursor_at_end, call autocomplete
	If suggestion active:
   	    On click, call cursor_moved:
	       - If cursor did not move, pass
	       - If cursor moved left, call ignore_suggestion
	       - If cursor moved right, call confirm_suggestion up to cursor
	    On key input, check if char received:
	       - If not char received, call cursor moved
	       - If cursor moved left, call ignore_suggestion, break
	       - If cursor moved right, call confirm_suggestion up to cursor
	    On char_received, if suggestion_active, call get_difference:
	       - Gets display text
	       - Removes last characters = len(suggestion_text)
	       - Removes first characters = len(current_text)
	       - Returns remaining characters as current_input

	    If not len(current_input) == 1:
	       - Call ignore_suggestion, break
	    If current_input == suggestion_text[0]:
	       - Call confirm_suggestion, break
	    Call autocomplete

	    When called, autocomplete:
	       - Calls ignore suggestion (deletes suggestion from display)
	       - Gets new suggestion
	       - Displays it in gray


TODO: Test for speed. If too slow, need to add cursor position checks
      to protect fast typists.
