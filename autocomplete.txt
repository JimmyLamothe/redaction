Functionality:
	- Autocomplete is displayed in gray
	- Autocomplete is only called when character is typed after end of last word
	- Changing the cursor position deletes the suggestion

Tracked:
	- current_text
	- current_cursor
	- cursor_at_end - BOOL
	- suggestion_text
	- suggestion_active - BOOL (cannot be True if not cursor_at_end)

Concept:
	If not suggestion_active, break
	If suggestion active:
   	    On click, check cursor position:
	       - If cursor moved, call ignore_suggestion, break

	    On key input, check if char received:
	       - If not char received, check if cursor moved
	       - If cursor moved, call ignore_suggestion, break
	
	    On char_received, if suggestion_active, call get_difference:
	       - Gets display text
	       - Removes last characters = len(suggestion_text)
	       - Removes first characters = len(current_text)
	       - Returns remaining characters as current_input

	    If not len(current_input) == 1:
	       - Call ignore_suggestion, break
	    If current_input == suggestion_text[0]:
	       - Call confirm_suggestion, break
	    Call autocomplete

	    When called, autocomplete:
	       - Calls ignore suggestion (deletes suggestion from display)
	       - Gets new suggestion
	       - Displays it in gray


TODO: Test for speed. If too slow, need to add cursor position checks
      to protect fast typists.
