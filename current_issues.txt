TODO: Bug: Geography differences between standard + translation

TODO: Translation Mode: Menu to activate mode
      		  	List of language pairs
			Backups for each pair

TODO: Feature: Pro mode - No buttons - No hints - Tab to switch
      	       Normal mode - Buttons - Hints - No tab to switch

TODO: Feature: Tutorial - Hints on startup first 5 times - scroll with buttons
      Progress: Working - Limit of times needed

TODO: Feature: Help - Help loads a tutorial type interface explaining menus, etc

TODO: Refactoring: Move all user data to Application Support

TODO: Feature: Add translation mode

TODO: Tests: Check if key_release or key_press events are better to catch.

TODO: Bug: If user types too fast, autocomplete can't keep up
      Idea: Set flag when user types - check flag before inserting text
      Progress: Autocomplete now fast enough, not a problem on test machine
      Test: Freeze and install on slow computer to check if still true

TODO: Bug: If user copy pastes something in the key widget, it can include
      	   line breaks.

DONE: Bug: Delete word interaction with spaces

DONE: Feature: Undo and Redo
      Progress: Clear autotext suggestions

DONE: Feature: Up and down arrow functionality

DONE: Bug: Alt_database - Fix repeated columns on initial creation
      Progress: Check if still a problem


DONE: Retest Autocorrect - bugs in Put mode when suggestion in Key box

DONE: Tests: Time difference between database and alt_database
      Result: Alt database was 100 times quicker and is now the default database.

DONE: Improve: Autocomplete needs more work - ideas here
      Idea: Autocomplete checks if cursor is at end of last character before running.
            Also runs if user continued typing at same cursor as previous
	    autocomplete.

DONE: Feature: Autocomplete should be in gray like Google does

DONE: Refactoring: Rename key_df since it now includes phrases
      Done: Renamed to db - stable name even if implementation changes

DONE: Bug: Autocomplete - previous_cursor in key.compare_states won't work if user
      	   has clicked elsewhere in the entry.
      Idea: Track mouse clicks
      Progress: New version doesn't use compare_states

DONE: Bug: Saving empty phrase should be impossible

DONE: Bug: Drag-select isn't handled by autocomplete
      	   Many small details to fix with mouse cursor changes

DONE: Refactor: All autocomplete functionality in single AutoText class
      		inheriting from tk.Text

DONE: Concept: Get mode vs Put mode
      Problem: Autocomplete must work differently depending on if you want
      	       to add an entry or get an entry - Implementation in progress
      Idea:    Click twice on key to return to get mode
      Idea:    Key turn white on first click from put mode



IGNORED: Refactor: Convert database to class?
	 Reason: Works fine as is, no reason to use a class here

IGNORED: Tests: Time difference between Pandas and SQLite
	 Reason: For now, speed is plenty sufficient as is. Revisit if needed

SKIPPED: Feature: Use Phrase space as menu hints
	 Reason: Not possible with Tkinter - Change to different GUI?

CHANGED: Refactor: Split handle_key_key_release into multiple functions.
      		   Rename to something making it clear it handles autocomplete.
		   Take a widget as argument and handle both phrase and key.
	 Reason: All functionality reworked and moved to AutoText class
